# Rest-Countries-API-Project
This project fetches and displays information about countries using Rest Countries API.  You can filter them by region or name.

This web application fetches and displays information about countries using data from the REST Countries API. Users can view all countries, filter countries by region, search for specific countries, and toggle between light and dark modes.

Features
1. Fetching Country Data
Upon loading the page, the application fetches data about all countries from the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).
The fetched data is then rendered onto the webpage, displaying each country's name, flag, population, region, and capital.
2. Filtering by Region
Users can filter countries by region using the dropdown menu provided.
When a region is selected, the application makes a new API request to fetch countries from the specified region and updates the displayed countries accordingly.
3. Searching for Countries
Users can search for specific countries using the search input field.
As the user types in the search input, the application dynamically filters the displayed countries based on the input text, updating the results in real-time.
4. Dark Mode
The application provides a dark mode feature for better readability in low-light environments.
Users can toggle between light and dark modes by clicking the "Dark Mode" button.
The appearance of the webpage changes dynamically to reflect the selected mode.
